# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction with AutoGluon
This repository explores the use of AutoGluon for predicting bike sharing demand. It includes code for:

Initial Training: Train a model on the provided dataset with basic preprocessing.
Feature Engineering: Enhance the model by extracting features from the datetime column (hour, day of week, month).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with hyperparameters of AutoGluon models (GBM, NN_TORCH) to improve performance.
Evaluation: Track the model's performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on both training and Kaggle evaluation metrics.

The repository also includes a report that details the training process, findings, and areas for further exploration.
